	<a name="Assam"></a><h2><li>Assam - <i><u>khaar</u></i></h2></li>
	
	<p>	
		Khar is a distinctive Assamese preparation that gets its unique astringent flavour
		from an indigenous alkaline product. Typically, analkaline extract is produced by 
		charring the sundried peel of humped feather back bananas, (locally called as ‘Bhim Kol’ )
		and sometimes even its root. The charred peel ( close to ashes ) are dipped in water and filtered extract is known as Khar.

	<a name="Madhya pradesh" ></a><h2><li>Madhya pradeash - <i><u>poha and jalebi</u></i></li></h2>
		<p>		
		Poha and Jalebi together is a new combination for me and this apparently is a popular street food there. Through this journey of the Indian states, I am learning so many new recipes and new combination of food.

<a name="Kerala" ></a><h2><li> Kerala - <u><i>biryani</u></i></li></h2>
<p>
	Unlike the other kind of popular biryanis where basmati rice is used, thalassery biriyani is made using a premium quality short grain rice which is also known as kaima rice or biriyani rice in Kerala. ... However the method of cooking Jeerakasala or kaima is different from cooking basmati rice

<a name="Andhra pradesh " ></a><h2><li>Andhra pradesh -<u><i> pulihora</u></i></li></h2>
<p>
An exotic version of tamarind rice, also known as Chitrannam, is enriched with spicy flavours to give it a sour and salty taste at the same time. One of the main ingredients is tamarind along with curry leaves, tomatoes, and mustard seeds. Pulihora finds its place in kitchens often during festivities and special gatherings. Try the authentic tamarind rice to get a taste of real Andhra cuisine

<a name="Orissa" ></a><h2><li>Orissa -<u><i> santula</u></i></li></h2>
<p>
	One of the main food dishes of Orissa/ Odisha, Santula is a classic Oriya delicacy that you can slurp and slurp even more on your trip. Made with raw papaya, brinjal, and tomato, the dish has more greens and fewer spices, thereby having all the makings for a healthy dish.
